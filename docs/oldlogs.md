# Version history

## Whats new in version X 1.1
- You can now change the bot's prefix.  
  You can do this by running `a!prefix` and whatever you want it to be.  
- Now when an error occurs, it will give you a message that you can report to the developer.  
  You might not be able to make sense of the issue but the dev can!  
- The help command now looks a bit nicer. Instead of just being a giant code block, its in a nice embed.  
- The fox command now sends a random fox if it can't find the type of fox you typed in.  
- Who pinged me? Oh. You did.  
  Thats because you can ping the bot instead of using the prefix.  

### Microupdate version X 1.1.5
Need to get info on your server or a user?  
We have commands for that now plus some more things in the works.

- guildinfo gives detailed information for your server.  
  Things such as channel and member counts.  
- userinfo gives information about a member like account creation date  
  user id, etc.  
- Time to kill! You can now kill your friends using our new kill command.  
- Uptime is not/no longer a command. You can see the bot's uptime with the `info` command.
