## Whats new in version X 1.2.1
**A small update to fix and change a couple things.**  

- Usage of the reset command now is added to event logs.  
- You can now see which modules are enabled or disabled.  
  You can use a!config to see this change.  
- Fixed a bug where using a prefix ending in ! has an extra ! in the helpo command
- a!purge will no longer give you an error if a mod log channel isn't set.


### Whats new in version X 1.2
**Welcome to the moderation update.**  
There are a couple mod features as well as the disabling/enabling of some modules.  

- Banning and kicking.  
  Having members breaking a whole lot of rules lately? You can now ban or kick.  
  Simply run a!ban or a!kick then the user and an optional reason.  
- Bulk message deletion. (purging)  
  Someone decided to spam your channel? Or are you trying to hide something.  
  Either way, you can now bulk delete messages using a!purge.  
- Module toggling.  
  You can now enable and disable modules such as NoNitro, Moderation, or if you're a person who dislikes fun almost like Steve from next door, you can disable that too.  
  (He literally threw a rock at my window cause I was playing MINECRAFT!)  
- All the logs.  
  You can now log who deleted a message, who banned a person, and more (soon).
  See configuration in the features page.  
- Slightly more details in the info commands (user and guild info).
  You now will get a bit more details on what a user is doing, their roles, and more.  
  The guildinfo command now show real members, bot members, and the total member count.


**And now a couple of technical changes you probably don't care about.**  

- Fox images now come from locally host files instead of some image storing site.
  This should hopefully help improve image loading times.
- Command descriptions for `a!help config` wasn't fully in quotes. This is now updated. 
- Commands under a!help now shows your server's prefix instead of the default.  



A public discord is underway as we inch closer to full release.  
We will announce when the Discord comes out!
