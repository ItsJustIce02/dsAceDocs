Only certain people are able to use this bot. If you invite this bot and you aren't enrolled in the test beta, the bot will let you know. Whats new in version X 1.1 You can now change the bot's prefix. You can do this by running a!prefix and whatever you want it to be. Now when an error occurs, it will give you a message that you can report to the developer. You might not be able to make sense of the issue but the dev can! The help command now looks a bit nicer. Instead of just being a giant code block, its in a nice embed. The fox command now sends a random fox if it can't find the type of fox you typed in. Who pinged me? Oh. You did. Thats because you can ping the bot instead of using the prefix. Microupdate version X 1.1.5 Need to get info on your server or a user? We have commands for that now plus some more things in the works. guildinfo gives detailed information for your server. Things such as channel and member counts. userinfo gives information about a member like account creation date user id, etc. Time to kill! You can now kill your friends using our new kill command. Uptime is not/no longer a command. You can see the bot's uptime with the info command. More features on the way in the next update.
