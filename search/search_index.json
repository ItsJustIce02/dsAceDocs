You can use a!config to see this change. Fixed a bug where using a prefix ending in ! has an extra ! in the helpo command a!purge will no longer give you an error if a mod log channel isn't set. Whats new in version X 1.2 Welcome to the moderation update. There are a couple mod features as well as the disabling/enabling of some modules. Banning and kicking. Having members breaking a whole lot of rules lately? You can now ban or kick. Simply run a!ban or a!kick then the user and an optional reason. Bulk message deletion. (purging) Someone decided to spam your channel? Or are you trying to hide something. Either way, you can now bulk delete messages using a!purge. Module toggling. You can now enable and disable modules such as NoNitro, Moderation, or if you're a person who dislikes fun almost like Steve from next door, you can disable that too. (He literally threw a rock at my window cause I was playing MINECRAFT!) All the logs. You can now log who deleted a message, who banned a person, and more (soon). See configuration in the features page. Slightly more details in the info commands (user and guild info). You now will get a bit more details on what a user is doing, their roles, and more. The guildinfo command now show real members, bot members, and the total member count. And now a couple of technical changes you probably don't care about. Fox images now come from locally host files instead of some image storing site. This should hopefully help improve image loading times. Command descriptions for a!help config wasn't fully in quotes.

This part of the documentation shows all kinds of commands and things with descriptions. Configuration This bot comes with some configuration on it. You can change things like prefix and more coming soon. a!prefix Changes the prefix for your server. Example: a!prefix t! a!config Shows the configuration for your server. a!set Sets config values (Such as mod logging.) modch Changes where moderation logs (ban, kick, etc.) goes. events Changes where event logs goes. (Such as config updates and message logging) msglogs Enable or disable message logs. (edits and deletes) a!reset Resets config values (Such as event logging.) modch Resets the mod log channel value. events Resets the event log channel value. Fun Fun commands are things like emotes, random games, and others. a!fox [Fox type] Get a random fox image. You can also get a random fox image of a specific type. Example: a!fox fen Fox types: Fennec / Fen Arctic / White / Snow Red Gray / Grey Don't ping me, bro. For a lot of the emote commands, you do not need to ping someone. You can simply type a server member's name and commands like a!slap will function just fine. Example: a!slap Odaya It even works with nicknames as well! Keep note that it is CaSe-SeNsItIvE. a!boop [member] Boop a friend or someone random in a server. Usage: a!boop @Odaya#8088 a!slap [member] Slap your friends and other members in a server. Usage: a!slap @Odaya#8088 a!pat [member] Give your friends a nice pat on the head. Usage: a!pat @Odaya#8088 Sometimes there is nobody around... You can use these commands on yourself. But you also can do just the emote command and it'll do something different. a!hug [member] Give somebody a hug. Especially when they need one! Usage: a!hug @Odaya#8088 a!uwu You know you want to. a!kill [member] Kill someone with a random death message Usage: a!kill @Odaya#8088 NoNitro\u2122 Be able to use custom emojis (included animated ones) without the need for Discord Nitro. (Tho you should still try and get Nitro bc you're supporting the platform you're using.) nmsg: Converts any {bracket emotes} into real physical emotes from an emote pack. Usage: nmsg: Wow. I love Portal {as} NoNitro relies on webhooks for this to work. Please be sure to have the bot create and manage webhooks in addition to use external emojis. You can disable this for your server using a!disable. NoNitro isn't available yet. We will announce when this feature becomes available. Extras Small commands such as a!info. This is a core module You cannot disable this. a!info Get basic info on the bot. This includes helpful links, the bot version, and its uptime. a!uptime Dedicated uptime command to show how long the bot has been online for. a!guildinfo Gives information about your server. a!userinfo Gives information about a member.","title":"Features and commands"},{"location":"features/#features-and-commands","text":"This bot has many features from random fun commands to helpful moderation tools.
